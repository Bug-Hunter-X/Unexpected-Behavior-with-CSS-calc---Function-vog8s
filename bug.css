The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it may not work as expected if the units are mixed or the syntax is incorrect.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely cause issues because the unit 'px' is missing. Another issue can arise if you use `calc()` with other CSS properties that depend on the calculated value before the calculation is finished, leading to unexpected results.  This can also occur with nested `calc()` expressions if the order of operations isn't properly handled.
