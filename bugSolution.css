The solution involves ensuring all units are explicitly defined within the `calc()` function and verifying the order of operations. If possible, simplify calculations to reduce the potential for errors. 

Here's how to fix the example `width: calc(100% - 10);` issue: 

```css
width: calc(100% - 10px);
```

For complex nested `calc()` expressions, consider using CSS variables (`--varName`) to break them down into smaller, more manageable parts, improving readability and maintainability. This also prevents unexpected results due to order of operation issues. 

Example of refactoring with CSS variables:
```css
:root {
  --main-width: calc(100vw - 20px);
  --sidebar-width: calc(var(--main-width) / 4);
}

.container {
  width: var(--main-width);
}

.sidebar {
  width: var(--sidebar-width);
}
```
